## 🚀 About Me

I'm a junior software engineer passionate about solving real-world problems through technology.

Currently, I develop solutions to optimize water usage in agriculture using Python, numerical simulations, and web development.  
Previously, I spent six years in digital journalism at ABC de Sevilla, where I honed my storytelling and communication skills.  
Now, I’m combining both worlds to build tools that matter.

## 🛠 Projects

🌱 [Water Simulation Algorithm](https://oa.upm.es/77114/) — 2024–2025  
**Challenge:** Agricultural drought modeling required a performance boost for field simulations.  
**Approach:** Migrated a legacy MATLAB model to Python using NumPy and Matplotlib.  
**Outcome:** Achieved a 50–70% speed improvement. Results presented at the 2025 CIGeo Engineering Congress.

🌾 SaaS for Irrigation Management — 2024–2025  
**Challenge:** Build a web app from scratch to help producers understand how water behaves in their crops.  
**Approach:** Participated in full lifecycle — from requirement gathering to MVP — using Nuxt.js (TypeScript) and Supabase.  
**Outcome:** Functional MVP tested in real agricultural settings; currently in development pipeline.

🐛 AI for Pest Detection — 2024  
**Challenge:** Early detection of pest outbreaks through drone imagery.  
**Approach:** Drafted a proposal for using AI image recognition to identify crop threats.  
**Outcome:** Approved as the basis for an upcoming R&D initiative.
