## 🚀 About me
Junior Software Engineer switching from newsrooms to code. I study Computer Engineering at the UOC. Built an irrigation SaaS MVP (Nuxt/TypeScript/Supabase) and rewrote MATLAB models in Python for a ~60% speed-up. Based in Seville, open to relocation, available now. Actively looking for a junior backend role; learning Java.

## 🛠 Projects
🌱 **Water Simulation Algorithm** — 2024–2025 — [link](https://oa.upm.es/77114/)  
I migrated a legacy MATLAB model to Python (NumPy/Matplotlib), profiled hot spots, and streamlined plotting, yielding **~60% faster** field simulations; results presented at the 2025 CIGeo Engineering Congress.

🌾 **SaaS for Irrigation Management** — 2024–2025  
From requirements to MVP with **Nuxt (TypeScript)** and **Supabase**, enabling producers to understand parcel-level water behavior and validate workflows in real settings.

🐛 **AI for Pest Detection** — 2024  
Drafted an R&D proposal leveraging drone imagery and recognition models to flag early outbreaks across crops.
